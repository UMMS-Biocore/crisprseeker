What is Compare 2 Sequences?
============================

Compare 2 Sequences generates all possible guide RNAs (gRNAs) for two input sequences, or two sets of sequences and generate scores for potential off-targets in the other sequence.


What is off target analysis?
============================

Off target analysis is the ddesign of target-specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas9 system by automatically calling findgRNAs, filtergRNAs, searchHits, buildFeatureVectorForScoring, getOfftargetScore, filterOfftarget, calculating gRNA cleavage efficiency and generate reports.
